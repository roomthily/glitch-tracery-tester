Create a generative Twitter bot using [Tracery](http://tracery.io/). 

This is a version of [Cheap Bots, Done Quick!](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) that runs as a single bot. It is based on [v21/tracerybot](http://github.com/v21/tracerybot). 

How to build your own bot:
- Click the settings above and "Remix" this project!
- Modify the [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) grammar in `grammar.json`. Here's a [tutorial](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html). The output will start from field "origin".

Or!

- Add another grammar to `public/grammars` and to the `select` element in `views/index.html` with the file name of that grammar. 

It does not tweet or toot or any of those things, but will generate some number of responses from the grammar for testing.

Example grammar in grammars cobbled together from tinysubversion's [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) dataset

###TODOs

🔜 add svg generator

🔜 random card background-color

🔜 the default bot favors the first column which is odd based on the stated statistical qualities of tracery.
